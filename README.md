# Chess-Engine
This is an amateur chess engine, and still in development. UCI compatibility for Arena is currently limited to Player vs Engine. The engine runs smoothly locally, so an external program like Arena is not required to play. 
##Engine Features
-negamax algorithm
-iterative deepening 
-principle variations
-hashtables
-zobrist keys
-null moves
-quiescent search
-dynamic alpha beta windows
-and more.
##Local Play
To play the engine without Arena, generate and run .exe file. Enter "local" in the cmd window. The board should subsequently be printed, and moves can be input in standard UCI format (a2a4).
