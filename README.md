# Chess-Engine

This is an amateur chess engine, and still in development. It has an ELO of ~ 2000. UCI compatibility for Arena is limited, but functional for standard play. The engine can run locally, so an external program like Arena is not required to play. 

## Playing In Arena

To play the engine in Arena, generate a binary file using the source material and follow the standard process of installing an Engine in Arena. *limited functionality at the moment*

## Playing Locally

To play the engine without Arena, generate and run a binary file. Enter "local" in the cmd window. The board should subsequently be printed, and moves can be input in standard UCI format (a2a4).

## Engine Features

The engine utilizes the following methods and more.  

```
negamax algorithm
forsythâ€“edwards notation
material evaluation
mobility evaluation
alpha-beta pruning
iterative deepening 
principle variations
hashing
transposition tables
zobrist keys
null moves
quiescent search
dynamic aspiration windows
pinned piece detection
double check detection
threatened squares
killer moves
perft
principal variation search
static exchange evaluation
```
Better UCI compatibility and history heuristics are at the top of the to do list. The code commented out in bot.cpp getMove function runs perft. From the tests I've run, the move generation for perft is perfect, but if you find an error please let me know!
